# What is aeonclassic?
Simply put, aeonclassic is a fork of TRTL in which the lead developer grabbed the 'How to become a blockchain dev' starter kit from Turtlecoin. Aeonclassic aims at mobile usage claiming that is AEON's true vision. However, Turtlecoin and forks of turtlecoin use highly unoptimized code and uses a databasing system which is not optimized for storage or for speed. 

Fun fact: TRTL exists because of AEON. A few guys who started TRTL did not like how AEON did things (slow and steady) so they went to do their own thing. The irony here is, AEON moves slow and steady. Turtlecoin moves faster. It appears that the TRTL way of doing things is meant to mock AEON.
